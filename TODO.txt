- Convert Object from trait to enum (be sure to keep mesh data on heap)
- Work out remaining weirdness with normal maps (has to do with object orientation)
- Get diffuse/specular interaction working properly
- Mesh UV mapping
- Denoising trick (increase roughness on each bounce)
- Transparency
- Atmospheric scattering
- Bloom lighting
